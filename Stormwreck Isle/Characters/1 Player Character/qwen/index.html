<p>I have been in studying and training in weapon mastery since I was a child at the temple of Correlon, and after passing all the tests and exams I'm ready to explore the world and adventure as a cleric</p>
<p>Qwen Naïfo was born into the sacred halls of the Temple of Corellon, nestled within the lush forests where the sun filtered through the leaves like golden threads. From a tender age, Qwen was immersed in the teachings of the elven deity, Corellon Larethian, god of art, magic, and beauty. But it wasn't the magic of spells that initially captivated Qwen; it was the elegance and finesse of martial combat.</p>
<p>As a child, Qwen would eagerly watch the temple's warriors train, their graceful movements akin to a carefully choreographed dance. Inspired by their prowess, Qwen begged the temple elders to allow training in the art of combat. Initially met with skepticism due to Qwen's young age and clerical lineage, the persistent young elf's determination eventually won them over.</p>
<p>Under the tutelage of the temple's most skilled warriors, Qwen's natural agility and keen focus flourished. With each passing year, Qwen honed their skills with various weapons, mastering the intricate techniques taught by the temple's masters. Though the path of the cleric was ever-present in Qwen's life, it was the melding of martial prowess with divine magic that truly ignited their passion.</p>
<p>Years of rigorous training and study passed, and Qwen emerged as one of the temple's most promising disciples. Passing every test and exam with flying colors, Qwen earned the respect and admiration of both peers and mentors alike. Yet, despite the comfort and familiarity of temple life, a restlessness stirred within Qwen's heart.</p>
<p>The whispers of distant lands and untold adventures called out to Qwen, beckoning them to explore beyond the confines of the temple walls. With blessings from the temple elders and a sacred symbol of Corellon adorning their person, Qwen set forth into the world, their faith unwavering and their martial skills finely honed.</p>
<p>Driven by a desire to spread Corellon's teachings, protect the innocent, and vanquish darkness wherever it may lurk, Qwen Naïfo now embarks on a grand adventure as a cleric. With a heart full of courage and a soul ablaze with devotion, Qwen's journey is bound to be filled with both peril and glory as they walk the path of the divine warrior.</p>
