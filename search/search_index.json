From a tender age, Qwen was immersed in the teachings of the elven deity, Corellon Larethian, god of art, magic, and beauty. But it wasn't the magic of spells that initially captivated Qwen; it was the elegance and finesse of martial combat. As a child, Qwen would eagerly watch the temple's warriors train, their graceful movements akin to a carefully choreographed dance. Inspired by their prowess, Qwen begged the temple elders to allow training in the art of combat. Initially met with skepticism due to Qwen's young age and clerical lineage, the persistent young elf's determination eventually won them over. Under the tutelage of the temple's most skilled warriors, Qwen's natural agility and keen focus flourished. With each passing year, Qwen honed their skills with various weapons, mastering the intricate techniques taught by the temple's masters. Though the path of the cleric was ever-present in Qwen's life, it was the melding of martial prowess with divine magic that truly ignited their passion. Years of rigorous training and study passed, and Qwen emerged as one of the temple's most promising disciples. Passing every test and exam with flying colors, Qwen earned the respect and admiration of both peers and mentors alike. Yet, despite the comfort and familiarity of temple life, a restlessness stirred within Qwen's heart. The whispers of distant lands and untold adventures called out to Qwen, beckoning them to explore beyond the confines of the temple walls. With blessings from the temple elders and a sacred symbol of Corellon adorning their person, Qwen set forth into the world, their faith unwavering and their martial skills finely honed. Driven by a desire to spread Corellon's teachings, protect the innocent, and vanquish darkness wherever it may lurk, Qwen Na\u00effo now embarks on a grand adventure as a cleric. With a heart full of courage and a soul ablaze with devotion, Qwen's journey is bound to be filled with both peril and glory as they walk the path of the divine warrior.

Their unexpected companionship came about when a local merchant sought aid in retrieving a stolen family heirloom, believed to be hidden deep within the nearby Whispering Woods. Durim, with his skills in tracking and combat, was hired for his brute strength, while Qwen, with her healing abilities and knowledge of the woods, was brought on to ensure their safety. At first, Durim eyed Qwen with suspicion, his mistrust of Elves deeply ingrained by years of isolation and skepticism. Likewise, Qwen found herself perplexed by Durim's gruff demeanor and reluctance to accept help from others. Their journey through the Whispering Woods was filled with mishaps and misunderstandings. Durim's impatience clashed with Qwen's calm demeanor, leading to bickering and occasional arguments. Yet, as they faced down the dangers of the forest - from mischievous sprites to thieving bandits - they found themselves relying on each other more than they had expected. In one particularly harrowing encounter with a pack of wolves, Durim found himself injured and cornered, his stubbornness nearly costing him his life. It was Qwen's quick thinking and healing magic that saved him, earning a grudging nod of thanks from the Dwarf. As they continued their quest, Durim and Qwen began to see past their differences, recognizing the value in each other's skills and strengths. Durim admired Qwen's compassion and selflessness, while Qwen appreciated Durim's determination and loyalty. In the end, they recovered the stolen heirloom and returned it to its rightful owner, their unlikely partnership strengthened by their shared adventure. Though they may not have started as friends, Durim Stoneforge and Qwen Na\u00effo obtained newfound respect for each other, their journey together a testament to the power of cooperation and understanding in the face of adversity. And as they continued their adventure on a mission to protect a ship on quiet waters, they carried with them the memories of their unlikely friendship, a small but meaningful bond in a world full of differences.","title":"Qwen and Durim"},{"location":"Player%20Characters/Additional/Qwen%20and%20Durim/#backstory-how-qwen-and-durim-met","text":"","title":"Backstory how Qwen and Durim met"},{"location":"Player%20Characters/Additional/Qwen%20and%20Durim/#involved-characters","text":"[Durim Stoneforge] [Qwen Na\u00effo]","title":"Involved characters"},{"location":"Player%20Characters/Additional/Qwen%20and%20Durim/#story","text":"In the humble village of Oakshire, nestled between the serene forests and the craggy mountains of Arinthia, Durim, a stubborn and slow-to-trust Dwarf, found himself begrudgingly paired with Qwen, a compassionate Elven cleric with a penchant for healing and a heart as pure as the woodland streams.
