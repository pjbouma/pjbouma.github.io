<p>Durim has not shared anything about his background</p>
<!--
Once a respected member of the mountain dwarf community, Durim Stoneforge was renowned for his exceptional craftsmanship and unparalleled skill in blacksmithing. Born into a family with a long lineage of revered artisans, Durim's destiny seemed set from the moment he first picked up a hammer and anvil.

However, Durim was not content with tradition alone. While his peers meticulously crafted weapons and armor by hand, Durim's mind was always buzzing with ideas for innovation. He saw the potential to revolutionize dwarven craftsmanship with the introduction of automated processes.

With relentless determination, Durim spent years experimenting and refining his designs. He crafted intricate mechanisms powered by steam and gears, capable of hammering out metal with precision and speed far beyond what any dwarf could achieve manually. His creations were nothing short of revolutionary, promising to increase production and quality while freeing up precious time for other pursuits.

Initially, Durim's inventions were met with curiosity and even admiration. The elders of his clan saw the potential benefits and allowed him to continue his work under close supervision. However, as Durim's automated crafting process became more advanced, whispers of dissent began to spread among the traditionalists.

Jealousy and fear of change festered within the community. Some saw Durim's creations as a threat to their way of life, a blasphemy against the sacred traditions of their ancestors. Rumors spread that Durim's innovations would lead to the degradation of craftsmanship, rendering the skills passed down through generations obsolete.

Unable to bear the growing hostility, Durim was eventually confronted by the council of elders. Despite his impassioned pleas and assurances of respect for tradition, the decision was made to exile him from the mountain stronghold. He was branded a heretic, cast out from the only home he had ever known.

Heartbroken and embittered, Durim wandered the vast expanse of the surface world, carrying with him the weight of his exile and the burden of his shattered dreams. Yet, despite the pain of rejection, the fire of innovation still burned within him. With each step into the unknown, Durim vowed to prove his worth and show the world the true potential of his automated crafting process, determined to forge a new destiny for himself beyond the confines of tradition.
